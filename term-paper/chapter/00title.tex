    \begin{abstract}
        \noindent The data provided by the \emph{Inside Airbnb} project contains various information
        about Airbnb accommodations available in Oslo, Norway, which are used to predict the
        price of an offer per night. For this purpose, a deep learning approach is applied
        where the focus is on explainability and interpretability of the model. After
        preprocessing the data, a fully connected feed-forward neural network is implemented
        to model the desired output variable. This is followed by an analysis of the results
        with special attention to the outliers in the data and how the model handles these. 
        In particular, a Variational Autoencoder is used in context of the outlier
        analysis, which creates two-dimensional latent space representations that allow to
        illustrate the difficulties that the outliers cause.
