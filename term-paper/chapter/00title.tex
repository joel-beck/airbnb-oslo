    \begin{abstract}
        \noindent The data provided by the Inside Airbnb project contains various information about Airbnb accommodations available in Oslo, Norway, which are used to predict the price of an offer per night.
        For this purpose, a Deep Learning approach is applied where the focus is on explainability and interpretability of the model. After preprocessing the data, a fully connected feed-forward Neural Network is implemented to model the desired output variable.
        In addition, several classical Machine Learning models are implemented to evaluate the performance of the Neural Network.
        This is followed by an analysis of the results with special attention to the outliers in the data and to which extent they influence the model's performance.
        In particular, a Variational Autoencoder is used in context of the outlier
        analysis, which creates two-dimensional latent space representations that allow to illustrate the difficulties that the outliers cause.
